Permisos
Permission	Meaning on a file	Meaning on a directory
r	The process can read the contents of the file, meaning the contents can be viewed and copied.	File names in the directory can be listed, but other details are not available.
w	The file can be written to by the process, so changes to a file can be saved. Note that w permission really requires r permission on the file to work correctly.	Files can be added to or removed from the directory. Note that w permission requires x permission on the directory to work correctly.
x	The file can be executed or run as a process.	The user can use the cd command to "get into" the directory and use the directory in a pathname to access files and, potentially, subdirectories under this directory.
